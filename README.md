# Web Applications for Everybody

This repository contains the coursework and projects for the **Web Applications for Everybody** Specialization on Coursera. In this specialization, we will be building dynamic, database-backed web applications using a combination of the following technologies:

- **PHP** - A server-side scripting language used to build dynamic web pages.
- **MySQL** - A relational database management system used to store and manage data.
- **jQuery** - A fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library.
- **Handlebars** - A templating engine used to generate HTML dynamically.

## Project Overview

In this specialization, you will learn how to:

- Build a dynamic website that allows users to interact with a database.
- Use PHP to process user input, interact with the database, and generate dynamic content.
- Use MySQL to create, read, update, and delete data in a database.
- Utilize jQuery for client-side interactivity.
- Use Handlebars templates to render dynamic HTML content on the front-end.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP**: Server-side scripting for dynamic content generation.
- **MySQL**: Database to store application data.
- **jQuery**: JavaScript library for making the front-end interactive.
- **Handlebars**: Templating engine for rendering dynamic HTML.

## Prerequisites
