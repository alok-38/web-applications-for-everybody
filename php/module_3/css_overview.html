    <h1>An Overview of CSS
    </h1>
    <p>These pages are intended to be explored in the developer console of your browser. You should also install the <a
            target="_blank" href="https://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer/">
            Web
            Developer
        </a> plugin from Chris Pedrick to play with CSS.

    </p>
    <p>We can use the <strong>style</strong>= attribute on HTML tags to apply various styles to text and blocks of text.

    </p>
    <p>The "Cascading" in CSS means that the closest style setting (monospace) "wins" over a syle setting (arial) that
        is "further away".

    </p>
    <p>We can put a border around a block of text. You probably want a CSS cheat sheet handy or use Google to search to
        find CSS values.

    </p>
    <p>While the style attribute works, it leads to overly verbose HTML so it is more typical to write CSS <a
            href="https://www.wa4e.com/code/css/rules.htm">&Implies; style rules</a>
        to apply styles to many tags at once.
